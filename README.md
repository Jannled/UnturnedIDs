# UnturnedIDs

This tool reads all existing items from your Unturned installation and helps you find the ID for your wanted item or vehicle. You also have the possibilitie to create loadouts for your server. And the best: This tool is always up to date because it is loading the items from Unturned itself. So if Nelson isn't doing any major changes it will give you the IDs when all other sources needed to be updatet!
